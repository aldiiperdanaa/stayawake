## Background
Executive Summary/Abstract:
In recent years, driving safety has become a global issue that demands serious attention. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that traffic accidents are the leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults. In Indonesia, this reality has become even more urgent with a significant upward trend in accidents. Data from the Central Bureau of Statistics recorded a spike in accident cases from 100,028 cases in 2020 to 103,645 cases the following year, and a drastic jump to 131,500 cases in 2022. This shows the urgency of improving road safety as a national priority. 
How can we reduce traffic accidents caused by drowsiness by applying machine learning? StayAwake is one such solution, an Android-based app designed to monitor drivers in real-time while driving. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision methods to identify signs of inattention or abnormal conditions in the driver's body, such as fatigue or drowsiness. Upon detecting such indications, StayAwake will activate an alarm to increase the driver's alertness. Thus, this application plays an active role in preventing traffic accidents that can be caused by drowsiness while driving.
